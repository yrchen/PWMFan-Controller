# Sample configuration for pwmfan_setup.sh
# This file should be placed at /etc/pwmfan_setup.ini

# Path to the PWM chip directory
# Check your system documentation or use `ls /sys/class/pwm/` to find the correct path
PWMCHIP_PATH=/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0

# PWM number to use (usually 0)
PWM_NUMBER=0

# Default PWM period in nanoseconds (e.g., 50000ns = 20kHz)
DEFAULT_PERIOD=50000

# Default PWM duty cycle in nanoseconds (must be less than or equal to period)
# 25000ns with 50000ns period gives 50% duty cycle
DEFAULT_DUTY_CYCLE=25000
